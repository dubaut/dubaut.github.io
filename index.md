## Building Dragons. Together.

In May 2019, I decided to create a JavaFX application written entirely
in Scala. Being new to Scala and not very proficient in JavaFX, I knew
I quickly would become quite a pain in the backside of those who know way
better than me and are willing to offer help and guidance. 

To give something back to the community, I decided to make my work open so
everyone interested can follow my endeavor.

If there is anything you want to know and not addressed here, feel free to
open an issue, and I do my best to come back to you as soon as possible.
